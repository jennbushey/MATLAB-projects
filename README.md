MATLAB projects and challenges to practice skills.

## [Numerical Methods for Determining Roots](https://github.com/jennbushey/MATLAB-projects/tree/main/Assignment1.m)

The task is to develop a computer program to find the roots of the following function:

$P = (-m + 4) e^{-0.5m}-2$.

1. Using Bisection Method (initial guesses of $m_l=0.5$ and $m_u=1.5$)
1. Using Newton-Raphson Method (initial guesses of $m_0=1.5$)
1. Using Secant Method (initial guesses of $m_{-1}=0.2$ and $m_0=0.7$)

Perform iterations until the approximate percent relative error falls below 0.005%.

## [Linear Equations and Systems](https://github.com/jennbushey/MATLAB-projects/tree/main/Assignment2.m)

The task is to develop a computer program to solve the following system of equations (employ initial guesses of 0.0 for all unknowns):

$-j - 2k + 4l - 2m  = 97.54$

$ j - 3k + 2l - n = 79.75$

$2k - 3l + 6m = 102.28$

$3j + l - 2m + 7n = 84.49$

$-3j - k + m - 2n =102.37$

1. Using Gauss-Seidel
1. Using Jacobi

Perform iterations until the approximation error is < 0.00001.

## [Interpolation](https://github.com/jennbushey/MATLAB-projects/tree/main/Assignment3.m)

The task is to develop a computer program to obtain the value of u at the corresponding t values of 50 and 90, respectively using the following methods:

1. Lagrange Interpolating Polynomials
1. Quadratic Spline Interpolation

## [Numerical Differentiation](https://github.com/jennbushey/MATLAB-projects/tree/main/Assignment4.m)

The data given represents the altitude L (in ft) of a small rocket that is launched vertically upward as a function of time t (in s)

The task is to develop a computer program to obtain the rocketâ€™s velocity (v) and acceleration (a) at each point using the finite- difference formulae with a truncation error of O(h2).

Display the results in three plots (altitude vs. time, velocity vs. time, and acceleration vs. time).
